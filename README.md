# Growing Devs #

Growing Devs is a shared space for a group of developers who wish to write
about their work without the isolation that comes with a solo blog, or the
constraints of writing only for the company you work for. Here you'll find
content about the technology, techniques, and process the authors are using.

### Benefits ###

* Our topics can be polyglot, without language restriction
* The format helps motivate the people involved to write
* Becomes a resource in its own right
* Shared readership
* Combined pagerank
* Shared promotion within the group
