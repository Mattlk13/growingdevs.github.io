Four years ago, I was sitting in my office in a U.S federal government agency bored out of my mind. Thinking about an idea I had during a recent trip home to Pennsylvania, I started researching web development. I joined a bunch of e-mail lists. I bought a PHP book. That book attracted dust, not my attention. So I reached out to some engineers, and many of them suggested I look into Ruby on Rails.

I spent hours scouring docs, reading Stack Overflow, and studying what a friend of mine who was helping me with my idea did. After two years, I entered LivingSocial's [Hungry Academy](http://www.hungryacademy.com/). It was, as the [Washington Post described](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/with-hungry-academy-livingsocial-aims-to-build-its-own-techies/2012/07/29/gJQAH5Q2IX_story.html), an experiment. More late nights ensued, and after five months I became a full-time Engineer at LivingSocial.

Looking back, while my path was a bit unusual at the time, my gravitation towards web development makes sense - especially considering my prior career in government. Facing the same options, Jack Dorsey described his rationale for choosing computer science over political science in a talk at [Stanford](http://ecorner.stanford.edu/authorMaterialInfo.html?mid=2637):

> I was deciding between political science at the time and computer science because I have always been fascinated by cities and at some point want to maybe potentially go into government. I'm still not quite sure if I have more effect there or more effect in programming. But I went away from political science because I realized that there are a lot of parallels between what you do in politics and what you do in government and writing policy and laws and what you do in programming. But the difference is the time scale. So, I could write a policy as a senator or as a mayor and I could see the effect maybe in eight years. But I could write that same policy and write a simulator around it and write populations around it and I could see that effect instantly with a computer. So, I went down the computer science route.

Dorsey's observation is spot-on. Years after they started, one of my coworkers at my previous job was _finally_ seeing one of the first projects they worked on come to fruition. I could go home at night with an idea, crank out a prototype and see it interacting in a matter of days. It was - and still is - addicting.

[Transition paragraph]

#### 1. Diversity is important

During Hungry Academy one of the hardest things to do was to not compare myself to others. There was my friend who wrote Java in his last job, and my other friend who was picking up Ruby like she had written it for years. It wasn't by design, but when you're in an environment where everyone knows they are vying to look attractive to an engineering team, some of us compared ourselves to each other. We knew who was doing the best and we wondered where we'd end up when the music stopped.

The problem was that we lost sight of something. Everyone brought something to the table. That's why we were selected in the first place.

#### 2. Empathy is necessary

One of the things I struggle with as an engineer is the concept of efficiency. I'm not opposed to it. As a matter of fact, I'm well aware that a part of my job revolves around creating it. However that doesn't mean it always sits well with me when I do.

This is because, in software development, creating efficiency sometimes correlates to someone else's job being made obsolete. I get that this is all a part of change and innovation. I get that it is the outcome of a changing workforce that is adapting to the challenges of an information economy.

But it's still tough.

A word that's mentioned in a good number of blog posts is empathy. More often than not it is in respect to the people who you deal with directly. To me, it's just as important to practice empathy with those who are both directly and indirectly affected by your work.

#### 3. Imposter syndrome is real

Coming out of a code school, it is quite difficult to not suffer from imposter syndrome. You graduate and end up working alongside incredibly talented people who are on your same team, but whose journey getting there was very different: years programming as a child, college degrees, etc.

#### 4. Balance is paramount

Sometimes, to compensate for imposter syndrome you end up working around the clock. I know I do. If you can relate to that, do yourself a favor: stop reading this article. Go for a walk. Go call someone you care about. Do something.

Seriously, this article will be here when you get back. So will the new feature that might get you promoted. So will the language you think you have to learn in order to get a better job. It will all be here.

What may not be is your sanity.
